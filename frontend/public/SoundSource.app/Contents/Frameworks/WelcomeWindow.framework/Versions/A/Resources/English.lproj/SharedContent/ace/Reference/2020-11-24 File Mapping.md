# Notes

[1] Later, we're going to have ACE tag its approved installs. If ACE has been previously approved, we'll assume that approval was NOT removed. In that case, we'll want to modify the install process on Big Sur, so we can avoid telling the user they'll need to do a bunch of things they don't actually have to do.

[2] This requires changes from Ed, so we can know if a system already has extensions allowed.
