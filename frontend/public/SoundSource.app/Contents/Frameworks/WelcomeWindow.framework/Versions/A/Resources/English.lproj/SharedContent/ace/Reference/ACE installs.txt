- ACE is not installed
	- If we find no valid “ACE was here” cookie, we show secure-install-intel.html (Intel) or secure-install-mchip.html (M Chip)
	- If we find a valid “ACE was here” cookie, we show simple-install1.html.

* To detect a VALID ACE cookie…what do we do?

- ACE is installed, but not loaded. This means ACE must not be authorized yet.
	- If ACE can't be authorized, the user must be instructed to “Enable system extensions” in the Security System Preference (secure-systemextensionapproval-mchip.html)
	- If ACE CAN be authorized, the user must be instructed to “Allow” ACE in the Security System Preference. (secure-ACEapproval-intel.html or secure-ACEapproval-mchip.html)

- ACE is installed, and loaded. 
The user needs to be shown nothing at all, or a simple “Update ACE” screen (update1.html) if an update is required.
